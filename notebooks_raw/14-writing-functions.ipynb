    "> ## Simulating a dynamical system\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In mathematics, a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space.  A canonical example of a dynamical system is a system called the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Define a function called `logistic_map` that takes two inputs: `x`, representing the state of the system at time _t_, and a parameter `r`. This function should return a value representing the state of the system at time _t+1_.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. Using a `for` loop, iterate the `logistic_map` function defined in part 1 starting from an initial condition of 0.5 for `t_final=10`, `100`, and `1000` periods. Store the intermediate results in a list so that after the `for` loop terminates you have accumulated a sequence of values representing the state of the logistic map at time _t=0,1,...,t_final_.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. Encapsulate the logic of your `for` loop into a function called `iterate` that takes the initial condition as its first input, the parameter `t_final` as its second input and the parameter `r` as its third input. The function should return the list of values representing the state of the logistic map at time _t=0,1,...,t_final_.\n",
